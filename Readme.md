# Car-Purchasing-Prediction

This project uses linear regression to predict the car purchasing price based on various factors such as gender, age, salary, debt, and net worth. The model is trained using a dataset of car purchasing data, and the prediction is made for a new data point.

## Features
- Predicts car purchasing price using linear regression.
- Handles categorical data (gender) by encoding it into numeric values.
- Provides a simple interface to input new data and receive predictions.

## How to Use
1. Upload the `car_purchasing_data.csv` dataset.
2. Run the Python script to train the model.
3. Input new data for prediction and view the predicted purchasing price.
